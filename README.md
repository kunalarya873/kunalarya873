# 👋 Hello, Fellow Coders! 🚀

I'm Kunal Arya, a Mechanical Engineering student at Zakir Hussain College of Engineering and Technology. Let's cut to the chase and get to know me in the coding realm:

## 👨‍💻 Coding Craftsman

I specialize in designing and developing machines using Solidworks and AutoCAD, with a keen interest in Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). My projects reflect a meticulous approach, combining design aesthetics with engineering precision.

## 🐍 Python Aficionado

From basic scripting to tackling complex algorithms, Python is my playground. Data structures bow to my command, and coding challenges are my daily workout routine.

## 📈 Data Analytics Maestro

Navigating the data landscape, I wield Python libraries—NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scipy—with finesse. SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Power BI are my trusted allies for extracting insights from raw data.

## 🌐 Full Stack Explorer

Venturing into the realms of HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap, jQuery, SQL, MongoDB, NodeJS, and ExpressJS. Currently honing my skills in React and Redux to achieve full-stack mastery.

## 👯 Collaboration Advocate

Eager to collaborate on Web Development and Data Science projects. Let's code together and create something extraordinary!

## 🤔 Internship Seeker

In pursuit of internships in Data Analysis, Python Development, and Web Development. Seeking opportunities to apply my coding prowess in real-world scenarios.
